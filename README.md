# Data Science Portfolio.
A collection of Data Science projects which I've worked on, presented in the form of iPython Notebooks.

## Machine Learning Fundamentals:
1. [Predict bikes rental demand:](https://github.com/pranav182/data_science_portfolio/blob/main/project_bike_rental_forecasting_basic.ipynb)
Built a machine learning model to predict the bikes demand given the past data using various best possible ML algorithms. Experimented with various models and checked which model performs best, fine-tuned the same model using one of the model fine-tuning techniques and found the best possible combination of hyperparameters for the selected model. Selected the model to make final predictions and compared the predicted values with the actual values.

2. [Noise removal from the images:](https://github.com/pranav182/data_science_portfolio/blob/main/noise_removal_from_images.ipynb)
Built a model that takes a noisy image as an input and outputs the clean image. Learnt about multilabel classification and multioutput classification system.

3. [Predict which passengers survived in the Titanic shipwreck:](https://github.com/pranav182/data_science_portfolio/blob/main/predicting_passenger_survival_in_titanic_shipwreck.ipynb)
Built a model to predict which passengers survived the RMS Titanic shipwreck with 81% accuracy.

4. [Build a spam classifier:](https://github.com/pranav182/data_science_portfolio/blob/main/building_spam_classifier.ipynb)
Achieved 97.89%  Precision and 97.89% Recall on a machine learning model to classify email as spam or ham from Apache SpamAssassinâ€™s public dataset.

6. [Build an Image Classifier in Fashion MNIST dataset:](https://github.com/pranav182/data_science_portfolio/blob/main/project_fashion_mnist_ML.ipynb)
Classified images from the Fashion MNIST dataset using scikit-learn, Python and machine learning algorithms obtaining 85% accuracy on the test data.

7. [Credit Card Fraud Detection:](https://github.com/pranav182/data_science_portfolio/blob/main/credit_card_fraud_detection.ipynb)
Applied the SMOTE technique to oversample the train data as the data was highly imbalanced and formed a new dataset with the thus obtained over-sampled datapoints. Achieved 92.5% recall rate on the Europe credit-card transaction data of 2 days to detect whether a transaction is fraudulent or not.

*Tools: Numpy, Scikit-learn, Pandas, Matplotlib.*

## Neural Networks and Deep Learning:

1. [Cat-Noncat classifier:](https://github.com/pranav182/data_science_portfolio/blob/main/build_an_image_classifier_with_numpy_cats_vs_noncats.ipynb)
Built a cat vs non-cat classifier using logistic regression, Numpy without using any packages like tensorflow.

2. [Classify Fashion-MNIST using Tensorflow:](https://github.com/pranav182/data_science_portfolio/blob/main/building_a_cnn_classifier_using_tensorflow_2_for_mnist_fashion_dataset.ipynb)
Classified images from the Fashion MNIST dataset using Tensorflow 2, Matplotlib, and Python achievveing accuracy of 88%.

3. [Image Classification with Pre-trained InceptionV3 Network:](https://github.com/pranav182/data_science_portfolio/blob/main/image_classification_with_pretrained_inception_network.ipynb)
Accessed the pre-trained Inception V3 model to predict the class of an input image.

*Tools: Tensorflow, Keras.*

## Deployment:

1. [Deploy machine learning models to production:](https://github.com/pranav182/deployment_ML)
Trained a ML model on MNIST and loaded it through FLASK app to predict class of a new image.

*Tools: Flask, Linux.*

## Data Analysis and Statistics:

1. [Project for Descriptive Statistics:](https://github.com/pranav182/data_science_portfolio/blob/main/Descriptive_Analysis.ipynb)
Learnt to analye data and find the mean, median, variance, standard deviation, plotting histograms, density plots, box plots and drawing inferences.

*Tools: Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib.*

## Python programming:

1. [Analyze Emails:](https://github.com/pranav182/data_science_portfolio/blob/main/python_project_churn_emails.ipynb)
Churned the mail activity from various individuals in an open source project development team.

2. [Built a complete BlackJack game from scratch using OOP](https://github.com/pranav182/data_science_portfolio/blob/main/01-Milestone%20Project%202%20-%20Assignment.ipynb)

*Tools: Python.*
